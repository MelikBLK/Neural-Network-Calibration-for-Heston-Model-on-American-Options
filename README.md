# 📈 **Neural Network Calibration for Heston Model on American Options**

---

## 📝 **Project Overview**

This project focuses on calibrating the **Heston Stochastic Volatility Model** using neural networks for American options. The goal is to apply deep learning techniques to effectively calibrate the model, improving its accuracy in pricing American options, where early exercise is possible.

---

## 🎯 **Objectives**

- 🔍 Implement the Heston Model for option pricing, focusing on American options.
- 🧠 Calibrate the model using neural networks to enhance predictive accuracy.
- 🛠️ Explore preprocessing techniques and hyperparameters for better calibration.
- 📊 Compare different calibration methods and measure improvements in option pricing.

---

## 📂 **Dataset**

The dataset for this project is based on **AAPL option chains** from **Q1 of 2016 to Q4 of 2020**. These options data include key information required for calibrating the Heston model, such as strike prices, expiration dates, and implied volatilities.

You can also find the aforementionned dataset along with **AAPL option chains from Q1 2021 to 2023**, available as CSV files directly in the repository.

## 📊 **Model Implementation**

- The **Heston Model** is used for pricing American options.
- A **Neural Network** is trained to calibrate the model, improving its parameter fitting.
- Multiple models are tested, and their performance is evaluated based on how well they predict option prices.

## 🔧 **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: Programming language.
- **NumPy** and **Pandas**: Data handling and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization of results.
